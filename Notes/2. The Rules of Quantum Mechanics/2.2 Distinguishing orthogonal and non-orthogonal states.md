#Notes

Consider a source that emits a qubit in either the state $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$. Can a detector make a measurement to find out which state the source sent, with _certainity_?

This is easy. For example, the detector could measure $Z=|0\rangle\langle 0|-|1\rangle\langle1|$. Or indeed, any measurement operator of the form

$$ A=\lambda_1|0\rangle\langle0|+\lambda _2|1\rangle\langle1| \quad \quad (\lambda_1\neq \lambda_2) $$

since if $|\psi\rangle=|0\rangle$, for example, $\text{Prob}(\lambda_1)=|| \big [|0\rangle\langle0| \big ]|\psi\rangle||^2=1$ and likewise $\text{Prob}(\lambda_2)=0$. So, we have essentially _sent a bit using a qubit_.

More generally, consider that source sends one of two general orthogonal and normalized states $|u\rangle$ and $|v\rangle$ such that $\langle v|u\rangle=0$. Then the detector can measure

$$ A=\lambda_1|u\rangle\langle u|+\lambda_2|v\rangle\langle v| \quad \quad (\lambda_1\neq \lambda_2) $$

to determine which state was sent, with certainty.

However, if the states were _not orthogonal_, then we can no longer detect _with certainty_ which bit was sent, since both eigenvalues have a chance of occurring. We might have a high chance of being right (if the states are approximately orthogonal), but we wont know for sure.
