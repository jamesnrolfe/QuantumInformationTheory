#Notes 

We will only need to consider one specific type to demonstrate [[9.2 Non-locality of quantum theory#^f08d7d|Bell's theorem]]. As such, we don't need a full theory of hidden variables, only one simpler model which is able to explain just this type of experiment. This is a lot easier - we refer to this special sub-case as a **local hidden variable model**.

Consider a situation where Alice and Bob, separated in space, perform a set of experiments, where in each one they locally perform measurements on half of an entangled state. We will abstractly label the measurement made by Alice as $x$ and the measurement made by Bob as $y$. We always denote the outcomes of $x$ as $a$ and the outcomes of $y$ as $b$.

We need to use a more abstract way of writing this because we don't want to refer explicitly to quantum formalism, but only to general, theory independent aspects.


> [!example] Example
> Consider that Alice and Bob share the *maximally entangled state*
> $$|\Phi \rangle=\frac{|00\rangle +|11\rangle }{\sqrt{ 2 }}$$
> Let Alice perform in one experiment a measurement of $X$, and in another a measurement of $Z$. We will label the first measurement by $x=0$ and the second $x=1$. In either case, we call the outcome $a$, which could either be $+1$ or $-1$. 
> We do a similar thing for Bob.
> In total, we will therefore consider 4 different experiments - one where they both measure $X$, one where they both measure $Z$ and two where they measure different operators.
> In each experiment, there are four possible *pairs* of outcomes based on the results they obtain: they both get $+1$, they both get $-1$, and two cases where one gets $+1$ and the other gets $-1$.

We can collect all the statistics produced by such collections of experiments into a set of conditional probabilities:

$$
P(a,b|x,y)
$$

There are thus 16 probabilities we are interested (four for each operator combination, of which there are 4 combinations). 

Considering the example above, the probabilities that will be observed can be calculated using the standard rules for performing measurements on quantum states. For example

$$
P(+1,+1|0,0)=P(-1,-1|0,0)=\frac{1}{2}
$$

i.e. the probability that both get +1 given that they both measure $X$ is equal to the probability that they both get $-1$ given that they both measure $X$, which is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$.

> [!help] Note
> To see the above, it is obvious when you realised that the "given that" term essentially means you can treat it as if they both *definitely* used $X$. Remember, $X$ is diagonalised with eigenvectors $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$, so we must write $|\Phi \rangle$ in terms of these eigenvectors to find the outcomes properly. It follows from that then that
> $$P(+1,-1|0,0)=P(-1,+1|0,0)=0$$

The probabilities $P(a,b|x,y)$ would be called *local* if they can also be reproduced by a local hidden variable model. 

Such a model would say that instead of making measurements on quantum systems in order to generate outcomes $a$ and $b$, in fact there were random variables sent to Alice and Bob, one corresponding to each measurement. Instead of performing measurements on quantum particles, the model says that there is *one random variable associated with each measurement* and *the value that random variable takes is the result of the measurement*.

*A probabilistic source $S$ emits hidden variables $\lambda$ to Alice and $\mu$ to Bob with probability distribution $P_{S}(\lambda,\mu)$. $\lambda=(a_{0},a_{1},\dots)$ specifies a deterministic list of outcomes such that $a=a_{x}$ when Alice thinks she performs a measurement labelled $x$, and similar case for Bob.*

In each run of the experiment, Alice might get a different list $\lambda=(a_{0},a_{1},\dots)$ and Bob a different list $\mu=(b_{0},b_{1},\dots)$, according to the joint probability distribution $P_{S}(\lambda,\mu)$. We say that a pair of lists $\lambda$ and $\mu$ correspond to a **deterministic strategy** as they are completely decided beforehand. *Crucially*, because they are determined by a *joint* probability distribution, there can be *correlations* - but these have a local explanation since they were created in the past from the same source.
