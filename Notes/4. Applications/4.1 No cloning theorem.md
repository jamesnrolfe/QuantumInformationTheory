Consider a proposed universal _copying operator_ which we will call $C$. $C$ should start with a particle in an arbitrary state $|\psi\rangle$, and a particle in a “blank” state $|\Omega\rangle$, and copy the state of the first particle onto the state of the second particle, while keeping the first particle in the state $|\psi\rangle$ - the equivalent of a, say `ctrl+c` .

$$ C|\psi\rangle|\Omega\rangle=|\psi\rangle|\psi\rangle $$

Since it is assumed to be universal (i.e. it can copy any state), it should also copy the state of the first particle if it is another state $|\phi\rangle$ i.e.

$$ C|\phi\rangle|\Omega\rangle=|\phi\rangle|\phi\rangle $$

But since quantum operations are linear, $C$ will also copy the superposition of $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ as follows, using the previous two equations.

$$ C\Big(|\psi\rangle+|\phi\rangle\Big )|\Omega\rangle=|\psi\rangle|\psi\rangle+|\phi\rangle|\phi\rangle $$

This, however, is not what we want. If the cloner had done its job properly, we should have mapped

$$ \left(|\psi\rangle+|\phi\rangle\right)|\Omega\rangle\mapsto\left(|\psi\rangle+|\phi\rangle\right)\left(|\psi\rangle+|\phi\rangle\right) $$

Thus there is no universal cloner.
