An operator $U$ on any vector space is **unitary** if it satisfies

$$ UU^\dagger=U^\dagger U=1 = I $$

The definition of unitarity implies that unitary operators are _invertible_. This means that their action can be “undone”, since if a vector has the action of $U$ and then $U^\dagger$ applied, then

$$ |v\rangle \mapsto U|v\rangle \mapsto U^\dagger U|v\rangle =|v\rangle $$

since $U^\dagger U$ is equal to 1, or in other words the identity matrix, which by definition does nothing to a vector it is applied on. Clearly, if we apply $U$ to a vector, we can undo this action by then applying $U^\dagger$.


Unitary operations preserve the inner product between vectors. Let us define

$$ |v_U\rangle=U|v\rangle \quad \text{and} \quad |w_U\rangle=U|w\rangle $$

It is then true that

$$ \langle v_U|w_U\rangle =\big (U|v\rangle\big )^\dagger U|w\rangle =\langle v|U^\dagger U|w\rangle=\langle v|w\rangle $$

We can note that for any orthonormal basis $\mathbb{C}^n$ that the following is a representation of the _identity operator_.

$$ I=\sum^{n-1}_{j=0}|e_j\rangle\langle e_j| $$

Note that this is self-adjoint.

Thus, as a couple of examples, both operators below are the identity operator on $\mathbb{C}^2$

$$ |+\rangle\langle +|+|-\rangle\langle -|=|0\rangle\langle0|+|1\rangle\langle 1|=I $$

and the following is an example of a unitary operator

$$ U=|+\rangle\langle 0|+|-\rangle\langle 1| $$

To check, consider $U U^\dagger=I$. $U^\dagger = |0\rangle\langle +|+|1\rangle\langle -|$, and so

$$ UU^\dagger = |+\rangle\langle +|+|-\rangle\langle -|=I $$
