#Notes 

We can reformulate the axioms of quantum theory directly in terms of density operators, which can then be applied to both pure and mixed states.

> [!info] Axiom 1 (States)
> The state of any physical system is represented by a density operator $\rho$ that is a positive operator on a Hilbert space, which satisfies the normalisation condition $\text{tr} (\rho)=1$.

> [!info] Axiom 2 (Evolution)
> Evolution, for a closed system, is described by a unitary operator $U$ such that 
> $$
\rho \to \rho' = U \rho U ^\dagger$$

> [!info] Axiom 3 (Measurement)
> Observables are associated with Hermitian operators. For the operator $A=\sum_{n}a_{n}\Pi_{n}$:
> The probability of obtaining the outcome $a_{n}$ is 
> 	$$\text{Prob}(a_{n})=\text{tr}(\rho\Pi_{n})$$
> The expectation value of $A$ is 
> 	$$\langle A\rangle =\text{tr}(\rho A)$$
> The state after obtaining the result $a_{n}$ is 
> $$\rho'=\frac{\Pi_{n}\rho \Pi_{n}}{\text{tr}(\rho \Pi_{n})}$$
> 


> [!Example] Example
> Let's return to the example in [[5.1 The density operator]] where we measured $Z=|0\rangle \langle 0|-|1\rangle \langle 1|$ on the density operator $\rho=\frac{1}{4}|0\rangle \langle 0|+\frac{3}{4}|+\rangle \langle+|$. We saw previously that 
> $$\text{Prob}(+1)=\text{tr}(\rho|0\rangle \langle 0|)=\frac{5}{8}$$
> from which it follows that 
> $$\text{Prob}(-1)=1-\text{Prob}(+1)=\frac{3}{8}$$
> which can also be verified to be equal to $\text{tr}(\rho|1\rangle \langle 1|)$:
> $$\begin{align}  
\text{Prob}(-1) & =  \text{tr}\left(  \left( \frac{1}{4}|0\rangle \langle  0|+\frac{3}{4}|1 \rangle \langle 1| \right) |1\rangle \langle 1|\right) \\ \\
&= \text{tr} \left( \frac{1}{4}|0\rangle \langle 0|1\rangle \langle 1|+\frac{3}{4} |+\rangle \langle +|1\rangle \langle 1| \right) \\ \\
&= \frac{1}{4}\langle 1|0\rangle  \langle 0|1\rangle +\frac{3}{4} \langle +|1\rangle \langle 1|+\rangle  \\
 \\
&= \frac{3}{8}
\end{align}$$
We can also see that $$\begin{align}
\langle Z\rangle &= \text{tr}(\rho(|0\rangle \langle 0|-|1\rangle \langle 1|)) \\
 \\
&= \text{tr}(\rho|0\rangle \langle 0|)-\text{tr}(\rho|1\rangle \langle 1|) \\
 \\
&= \text{Prob}(+1)-\text{Prob}(-1) \\
 \\
&=\frac{5}{8}-\frac{3}{8} =\frac{1}{4}
\end{align}$$
The state after the outcome +1 is given by$$
\begin{align}
\rho'&= \frac{|0\rangle \langle 0|\rho|0\rangle \langle 0|}{\text{tr} (\rho|0\rangle \langle 0|)} \\
 \\
&= \frac{\langle 0|\rho|0\rangle |0\rangle \langle 0|}{\langle 0|\rho|0\rangle } = |0\rangle \langle 0|
\end{align}
$$ That is, after the measurement of $Z$, if the outcome is +1 is obtained, the system is left in the state $|0\rangle$ with certainty. This is true even if the state of the system was initially a mixed state.
