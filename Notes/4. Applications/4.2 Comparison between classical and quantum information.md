#Notes 

**Classical information** is described by classical bits, which can be zero _or_ one. A $n$-bit system can be in any _one_ of $2^n$ states $000\dots0$ to $111\dots 1$.

Classical information can be written, read and copied.

**Quantum information** is described by [[1.1 Vectors, Dirac notation|qubits]], which are of the form

$$ \alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle $$

A quantum $n$-qubit system can be in an arbitrary superpositions of the $2^n$ states $|000\dots0\rangle$ to $|111\dots1\rangle$.

We need infinitely many bits to describe the state of a single qubit (since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex, and so require infinitely many decimal places to describe fully). Thus we can say informally that we can write an infinite amount of information onto a qubit. However, we cannot read this information (when making a measurement, we do not learn $\alpha$ or $\beta$, only the eigenvalues of the measurement operator).

We can also not copy quantum information (see [[4.1 No cloning theorem]]).
