#Notes 

A **linear operator** on _any_ vector space takes vectors to vectors in such a way that we can treat the action of the operator separately on each state.

$$ A(a|v\rangle+b|w\rangle)=aA|v\rangle + bA|w\rangle $$

We can define the action of an operator by how it changes a set of basis states.

Suppose that $|v_i\rangle$ for $i=1,2,\dots,n-1$ is a basis for $\mathbb{C} ^n$. We can then define the **matrix of the operator $A$** _with respect to the basis_ by

$$ A|v_j\rangle =\sum_i A_{ij}|v_i\rangle $$

Given a matrix and a basis, we can define an operator associated to the matrix (instead of the other way around as before).

In this course, we almost exclusively use the this _standard basis_ for $\mathbb{C} ^2$, so we can think of the operators and their matrices in this basis interchangeably.

An important set of operators are the **Pauli operators $X,Y,Z$** defined by

$$ \begin{aligned}X|0\rangle &= |1\rangle;\quad X|1\rangle=|0\rangle \\ Y|0\rangle &= i|1\rangle;\ \;\,Y|1\rangle=-i|0\rangle\\Z|0\rangle &= |0\rangle; \quad Z|1\rangle =-|1\rangle\end{aligned} $$

Their associated matrices are

$$ \sigma_x=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_y=\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i\\ i & 0\end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix} $$

Another operator on $\mathbb{C} ^2$ which we refer to as the **identity operator $I$** are defined

$$ I|0\rangle=|0\rangle, \quad I|1\rangle=|1\rangle $$

This simply takes the state it acts on to the current state. In other words, it does nothing (like multiplying by 1). It is, however, very useful.

We will also define here on more operator $R(\theta)$ which depends on a real parameter $\theta$.

$$
R(\theta)|0\rangle=\cos \theta|0\rangle+\sin\theta|1\rangle, \quad R(\theta)|1\rangle =-\sin\theta|0\rangle+\cos\theta|1\rangle
$$
