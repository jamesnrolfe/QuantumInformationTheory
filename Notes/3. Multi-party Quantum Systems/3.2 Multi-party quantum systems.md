The Hilbert space of $n$ qubits can be generalised to

$$ \mathcal H=\mathbb{C}^2\otimes \mathbb{C} ^2 \otimes \dots \otimes \mathbb{C}^2=\mathbb{C} ^{2n} $$

It is spanned by the $2^n$ states $|0\rangle\otimes |0\rangle \otimes \dots \otimes |0\rangle$ to $|1\rangle \otimes |1\rangle \otimes \dots \otimes |1\rangle$, and a general state is a complex superposition of these states.
