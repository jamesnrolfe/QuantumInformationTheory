#Notes 

Let’s consider the scenario where a source sends one qubit to Alice, and a second to Bob. The pair of particles is in the **Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state**.

$$ |\psi\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle|1\rangle-|1\rangle|0\rangle}{\sqrt 2} $$

Imagine Alice measures $Z$ on her qubit. If Bob does nothing, then this corresponds to $Z\otimes I$ on the whole Hilbert space. In order to understand the outcomes of the measurement, we need to write this operator in _spectral decomposition_ (see [[1.9 Spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators]]).

$$ Z\otimes I=\left(|0\rangle\langle0|-|1\rangle\langle1|\right)\otimes I=|0\rangle\langle0|\otimes I-|1\rangle\langle1|\otimes I:=P_+-P_- $$

Let us consider the case that the eigenvalue is $\lambda=+1$.

$$ P_+|\psi\rangle=|0\rangle\langle0|\otimes I|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}|0\rangle|1\rangle $$

Thus, the probability of this outcome is the coefficient squared i.e. $1/2$ and the state after measurement of this outcome is $|01\rangle$.

Now image than Bob also measures $Z$ on his qubit, with the pair of particles _in the post measurement state $|0\rangle|1\rangle$._ This corresponds to $I\otimes Z$ on the whole space, and so

$$ I\otimes Z=I\otimes\left(|0\rangle\langle0|-|1\rangle\langle1|\right)=I\otimes|0\rangle\langle0|-I\otimes|1\rangle\langle1|:=Q_+-Q_- $$

Let us consider the situation that Bob gets $\lambda=-1$.

$$ Q_-|0\rangle|1\rangle=\big(I\otimes |1\rangle\langle1|\big )|0\rangle|1\rangle =|0\rangle|1\rangle $$

Thus Bob has a probability of $1$ to get this outcome.

By the way, this outcome means that Alice’s particle is in the state $|0\rangle$ and Bob’s particle is in the state $|1\rangle$.

So, if Alice measures $\lambda=+1$, then it is _certain_ that Bob will get $\lambda=-1$. This is also true the other way around. We have exact **anti-correlation**. This anti-correlation occurs if Alice and Bob measure any operator with eigenvalues $\pm1$ (e.g. they both measure $X$, or both measure $Y$).

Now consider that Alice and Bob, rather than having particles in the singlet state, each have a qubit with the qubits being in the general case.

$$ |\Psi\rangle=\alpha_{00}|0\rangle|0\rangle+\alpha_{01}|0\rangle|1\rangle+\alpha_{10}|1\rangle|0\rangle+\alpha_{11}|1\rangle|1\rangle $$

(see [[3.1 The Hilbert space of two-party quantum systems - the tensor product]]).

Now consider that Alice measures $Z$. It is convenient for the maths to write

$$ |\Psi\rangle=|0\rangle\Big(\alpha_{00}|0\rangle+\alpha_{01}|1\rangle\Big)+|1\rangle\Big(\alpha_{10}|0\rangle+\alpha_{11}|1\rangle\Big) $$

What happens if Alice gets the eigenvalue $\lambda=+1$? As before, write $Z\otimes I=P_+-P_-$ and then we can say

$$ P_+|\Psi\rangle=|0\rangle\langle0|\otimes I|\Psi\rangle=|0\rangle\Big(\alpha_{00}|0\rangle+\alpha_{01}|1\rangle\Big) $$

i.e. the state is unentangled, and Alice’s particle is in the state $|0\rangle$ and Bob’s particle is in the normalised version of $\alpha_{00}|0\rangle+\alpha_{01}|1\rangle$.

More generally, consider Alice and Bob each a qubit and Alice measures a general operator

$$ A=\lambda_1|e_1\rangle\langle e_1|+\lambda_2|e_2\rangle\langle e_2| $$

The operator on the whole Hilbert space is $A\otimes I$. If Alice gets the outcome $\lambda_1$, then the state becomes (the normalised version of)

$$ |e_1\rangle\langle e_2|\otimes I|\Psi\rangle=|e_1\rangle|\eta\rangle $$

where $|\eta\rangle$ is some state of Bob’s system (the state is a product state).
