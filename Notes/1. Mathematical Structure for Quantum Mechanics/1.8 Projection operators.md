#Notes 

For any orthonormal set of vectors $|v_i\rangle$ for $i=0,1,\dots ,k-1$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ (note that $k$ may be less than $n$ here), the operator

$$ P=\sum^{k-1}_{i=0}|v_i\rangle\langle v_i| $$

is called a **projection operator** onto the space spanned by the vectors $|v_i\rangle$, $i=0,1,\dots k-1$.

Projection operators as defined above should satisfy

$$ \begin{aligned}P&=P^\dagger \\P^2&=P\end{aligned}

$$

*This implies that projection operators are Hermitian.*

These conditions are sometimes used to _define_ a projection operator. Any operator satisfying them can be written as

$$ \sum^{k-1}_{i=0}|v_i\rangle\langle v_i| $$

for suitable $|v_i\rangle$.

Another quick thing to note is that if $P$ is a projection operator, then so is $1-P$.
