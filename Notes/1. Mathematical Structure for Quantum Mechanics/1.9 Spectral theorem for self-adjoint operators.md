**Spectral theorem** states that self-adjoint operators are _diagonalizable_ and _have real eigenvalues_. Thus, any self-adjoint operator $A$ on $\mathbb{C} ^n$ may be written as

$$ A=\sum^{n-1}_{i=0}\lambda _i|v_i\rangle\langle v_i| $$

for some orthonormal basis of the space $|v_i\rangle$, $i=0\dots n-1$. We can see above that this looks similar to the definition of a projection operator in [[1.8 Projection operators]], and we may instead group together the eigenvalues and write it as

$$ A=\sum_{\alpha}\lambda_\alpha P_\alpha $$

where $\alpha$ loops through the _distinct_ eigenvalues. All degenerate eigenvalues are grouped together in the projection operator. For example, if $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ share the eigenvalue $1$, then an example of the projection operator might be $P_1=|0\rangle\langle0|+|1\rangle\langle1|$, with $\lambda_1=1$.

If $|v\rangle$ is a _normalized_ eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, then

$$ A|v\rangle=\lambda |v\rangle \quad \Rightarrow \quad \langle v|A|v\rangle=\lambda \langle v|v\rangle=\lambda $$

We might also note that

$$ \bigg [\langle v|A|v\rangle\bigg ]^*=\bigg [\langle v|A^\dagger|v\rangle\bigg ]=\langle v|A|v\rangle

$$

*This is true because $A^\dagger =A$.*

This implies that $\lambda$ is real, since $\lambda =\langle v|A|v\rangle$, and hence the above states $\lambda^*=\lambda$, which can only be true when $\text{Im}(\lambda)=0$.
