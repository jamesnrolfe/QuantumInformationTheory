#Notes 

The aim of cryptography is to send a message to someone, without an *eavesdropper* listening in and being able to read the message. 

Some coding schemes use mathematical techniques to encode messages. An early example is the **Caesar cypher**, where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by one three places further in the alphabet (A becomes D, B becomes E etc.). However, the problem with this is that an eavesdropper, if they suspect that letters are being replaced in this way, even if they don't know how many places further each letter is coding to, they still only have 25 possible messages to look at, which can be done easily by hand. 

It might be a better strategy to replace every letter by applying a random permutation to the set of letters. Now, the number of possible strategies is $26! \approx 2^{88}\approx 10^{26}$, so it is essentially impossible to try all the options in a reasonable amount of time. However, it turns out this is not a good strategy for anything other than very short texts, because *letter frequency* is not random. If a word begins with E for example, it is very likely that the next letter will be T, and so on. This can be used to decode messages quite easily (like those mobile games you get adverts for - they are essentially just doing this).

These two schemes, and many others currently in use, are they type whereby their effectiveness is determined essentially by how good the eavesdroppers computer is (or specifically, their ability to solve mathematical problems). A faster computer can check more permutations quicker, and so can decrypt a message faster.

A very different, but often safer strategy is to use shared random strings to encode data. The classical and quantum versions of this are described below. A key point here is that whilst the security of a classical encryption strategy is determined by how difficult the maths is to solve, the security of a quantum encryption strategy depends on the laws of physics. 

### Classical one-time pad
Alice wants to send a message secretly to Bob, which we can think of as some binary string $a$, for example

$$
\begin{matrix}
a: &&0&1&1&0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1
\end{matrix}
$$

Imagine that they previously arrange to share, secretly, a long random string of bits, which we call the **key**, $k$. Often, in practice, this is done physically (since we don't want an eavesdropper to intercept the key).

$$
\begin{matrix}
k: && 1&0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{matrix}
$$

The message Alice sends to Bob then should not be $a$ directly. Instead, she will send the **bit-wise sum** of the key and her message.

$$
\begin{matrix}
a: && 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
k: && 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
m=a\oplus k: && 1 &  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1
\end{matrix}
$$

The key point here is that $m$ is a random string, so an eavesdropper (we will call her Eve) cannot decode it without knowing what the key was. Bob can decode the message with the key by finding the bit-wise sum of the key and the encoded message.

$$
\begin{matrix}
a: && 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
k: && 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
m=a\oplus k: && 1 &  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
a=m\oplus k: && 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{matrix}
$$

However, this method is not flawless. 
- This works fine if Eve does not know $k$. However, if she finds this, and copies it, then the method is no longer useful.
- If Eve has intercepted $k$ and Alice and Bob learn that she has, they can no longer use the one-time pad. Similarly, in the case of ciphers such as the Caesar cipher, if Eve knows how the cipher works, then she can read all messages sent between Alice and Bob.
- It is a particular problem if Eve manages to do this without Alice and Bob knowing, since they continue to send messages that *they assume* are secure.
- However, if Alice and Bob manage to share the key without Eve gaining access, then the messages are secure, and Eve has no way of decoding them (given the messages are random etc. think The Imitation Game, where the code was deciphered by learning what was being said. Another key aspect of that film was that they didn't want to reveal that they had deciphered the code).

### Quantum key distribution
This is a method for providing Alice and Bob a shared, random secret *key*. The key difference here is that if Eve manages to intercept the message, Alice and Bob will be able to tell, and hence not use that key. 

The key principles at play here are 
- You cannot make a measurement of a system without disturbing it. If a system is in a state $\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$, then upon measurement it will collapse into $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$. 
- You cannot reliably distinguish between non-orthogonal states. 
- You cannot copy a quantum state (see [[4.1 No cloning theorem]]). This means that if the courier transferring the key is malicious, they cannot copy the key and hand it on to Eve. 

Let's consider a bad protocol for sharing keys. 

Imagine Alice produces a random string of 0s and 1s. She encodes 0 as $|0\rangle$ and 1 as $|1\rangle$, and sends the string as qubits to Bob. 

Bob then measures $Z$ on each qubit, and if he gets $\lambda=+1$, then he interprets this as 0 and if he gets $\lambda=-1$ he interprets this as 1. He now shares the random key with Alice. 

The problem with this is that Eve could intercept each qubit and measure $Z$ on it as well. She could learn the state, but since $Z$ is diagonal, she wont affect the state. She can then send the qubit to Bob and he wont know that it has been intercepted.

### Bennet 92 (B92)
The aim of this technique is to allow Alice and Bob to share a secret random string, as we've been attempting.

Consider the situation whereby Alice sends Bob a qubit either in state $|0\rangle$ or $|+\rangle$. 

If Bob measures $Z$ and gets $\lambda=+1$, then he is not sure which state Alice sent, it could have been $|0\rangle$ or $|+\rangle$ (since they both contain $|0\rangle$ terms). However, if he measures $Z$ and gets $\lambda=-1$, he is sure Alice sent $|+\rangle$ (since it is the only option with a $|1\rangle$ term).

Similarly, if Bob measures $X$ and gets $\lambda=+1$, then he is not sure which state Alice sent, it could have been $|0\rangle$ or $|+\rangle$, but if he measures $\lambda=-1$ then he can be sure that he found $|0\rangle$. This is because $X=|+\rangle \langle+|-|-\rangle \langle-|$ and written in this basis, $|0\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}(|+\rangle+|-\rangle)$. 

The protocol for B92 is as follows. 

Firstly, Alice choses a random string, which we will call $a$.

$$
\begin{matrix}
a:&&1&1&0&0&1&0&1&1&0&0
\end{matrix}

$$

She encodes 0 as $|0\rangle$ and 1 as $|+\rangle$. Hence we get 

$$


\begin{matrix} \\
a:&&1&1&0&0&1&0&1&1&0&0\\
 &&|+\rangle&|+\rangle&|0\rangle&|0\rangle&|+\rangle&|0\rangle&|+\rangle&|+\rangle&|0\rangle&|0\rangle
\end{matrix}


$$

She sends this string to Bob.

Bob now choses *his own* random string, independent of Alice's. He will use this to decide which operator to decode each qubit with. If he gets 0 he decodes that qubit with $X$, and if he gets 1 he decodes with $Z$.

$$
\begin{matrix}
b:&&1&0&1&0&0&1&1&1&0&0 \\
&&Z&X&Z&X&X&Z&Z&Z&X&X 
\end{matrix}

$$

He looks at the cases where he got $\lambda=-1$. In those cases, he takes the bit to be 0 if he measured $X$ and 1 if he measured $Z$.

$$
\begin{matrix}
a:&&1&1&0&0&1&0&1&1&0&0\\
 &&|+\rangle&|+\rangle&|0\rangle&|0\rangle&|+\rangle&|0\rangle&|+\rangle&|+\rangle&|0\rangle&|0\rangle \\ \\
b:&&1&0&1&0&0&1&1&1&0&0 \\
&&Z&X&Z&X&X&Z&Z&Z&X&X  \\ \\
\lambda:&&-1&+1&+1&+1&+1&+1&-1&-1&+1&-1 \\ 
\\
\text{ does }\lambda=-1?&&\text{yes}&\text{no}&\text{no}&\text{no}&\text{no}&\text{no}&\text{yes}&\text{yes}&\text{no}&\text{yes} \\ \\

\text{Bob's string:}&&1&?&?&?&?&?&1&1&?&0
\end{matrix}

$$
~={Grey}Remember, if we get $\lambda=+1$ for either result, we don't know what the bit could have been, so it can't be used in Bob's bit at the end.=~

The next step is for Bob to announce publicly the cases in which *he is sure of the bit that Alice sent* i.e. those cases where he got the eigenvalue $-1$ when measuring $X$ or $Z$. He does not announce whether he measured $X$ or $Z$, and this is the key point! Eve has no idea what operator Bob measured, and so even if she intercepted the string and saw which bits Bob knows, she would still then have to *guess* what operator he used for each one, which for long strings, is not feasible.

So Alice and Bob can discard the bits that Bob doesn't know, and now have a secret string, in this case 1110. 

Alice and Bob can check there has been no interference in the creation of the key. They select a random subset of the key, and they announce publicly which bits they are and what the values were. Alice and Bob should have the same values. If not, can deduce that there might be a security problem. It is important to note that they discard the subset they use to check the key, since now its public knowledge (and can be useful to Eve).

From Eve's perspective, how would she potentially intercept the qubits, copy them, and then send them on, such that she has the same qubit as Bob? She could the wait until Alice and Bob's announcements and the decide what to keep. But there is no way in quantum mechanics to copy the qubit, or to read it without disturbing it. So, she has to read each qubit, remember them, and then *resend* them to Bob.

Maybe Eve knows that Bob used $X$ and $Z$ measurements, and that Alice sends bits in states $|0\rangle$ or $|+\rangle$. Imagine Alice sends one qubit, $|0\rangle$.

Eve can measure $X$, or $Z$. Let's say she choses $Z$. She will get a $\lambda=-1$ or a $\lambda=+1$ with equal probability. 

In the case $\lambda=-1$, Eve knows that Alice sent a $|0\rangle$ and Eve then resends a $|0\rangle$ to Bob. In this case, Eve has learned what state was sent without disturbing anything. 

In the case $\lambda=+1$, Eve does not know whether Alice sent $|0\rangle$ or $|+\rangle$. Eve now has a big problem - she has to guess which state to send to Bob! She might guess right 50% of the time, but if she guesses wrong, then she will send the wrong qubit.

If Eve makes a mistake, this isn't always bad. For example, if Alice sent a $|0\rangle$, Eve measures $+1$ and then sends $|+\rangle$ to Bob, Bob can still measure $Z$ and be certain of this result (i.e. he gets $\lambda=-1$), and so it will remain in his string at the end. Bob would interpret this result as a 1 whereas Alice intended for it to be a 0.

So, when Alice and Bob chose their subset, there is a chance that this erroneous bit will not be included, and hence they will end up with different keys, despite not realising that anything is wrong.
