#Notes
 

States of quantum systems are represented as _vectors_. We will use **Dirac Notation** for these vectors and denote them as **kets**.

$$ |v\rangle $$

We will use a set of _basis vectors_

$$ \{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, \dots, |n-1\rangle \} $$

to form complex linear combinations.

$$ |v\rangle =\sum^{n-1}_{j=0} v_j|j\rangle $$

We denote the set of such vectors as $\mathbb{C}^n$. So for example, if our basis contained three basis vectors $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle \}$, then we would have $n=3$, such that we denote this basis $\mathbb{C}^3$. This makes sense if we consider it as a three dimensional space.

The complex numbers $v_j$ are the components of $|v\rangle$ with respect to the given basis.

$$ |v\rangle=v_0|0\rangle+v_1|1\rangle+\dots $$

We can write these components as a column vector.

$$ \begin{bmatrix}v_0 \\v_1 \\ \vdots \\ v_{n-1}\end{bmatrix} $$

A basis set of vectors denoted $\mathbb{C}^2$ will be of the form

$$ |v\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle $$

A system whose _space of states_ is $\mathbb{C}^2$ is called a **qubit**.

We can note that in order to specify the state of a qubit we need an infinite number of bits (since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can take any values in $-1 \leq \text{Re}(\alpha)\leq 1$, $-1 \leq \text{Re}(\beta)\leq 1$, such that $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$.

Consider representing the real parts in binary - we would need infinitely many binary places after the binary point to full specify $\text{Re}(\alpha)$ and $\text{Re}(\beta)$.
