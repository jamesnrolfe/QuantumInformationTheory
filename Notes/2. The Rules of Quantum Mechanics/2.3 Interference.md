#Notes 

Consider the state $|0\rangle$ on $\mathbb{C} ^2$. If we measure $X$, we find $\text{Prob}(\lambda=-1)=1/2$. Similarly, if the state is $|1\rangle$ and we measure $X$ we also find $\text{Prob}(\lambda=-1)=1/2$.

Now consider the following superposition of these states.

$$ |\psi\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle+|1\rangle}{\sqrt2}=|+\rangle $$

Now, if we measure $X$ we find $\text{Prob}(\lambda=-1)=0$. Thus if we have two states and we superpose them, the probabilities of the outcomes of a given measurement _do not add_. In this example, we clearly have **destructive interference**.

In general, the probability of an event depends on the relative phase between the terms $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. Hence the relative phase, unlike the overall phase, _does_ have some physical significance.

For example, if the state we start in is

$$ |\psi\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle+e^{i\phi}|1\rangle}{\sqrt2} $$

then we find $\text{Prob}(\lambda=-1)=\frac12(1-\cos\phi)$ when we measure $X$.
